# Visualizations

## Average Trip Duration Change by Age

If we look at the records by age, in terms of the distance and duration, most young users had higher trip duration on Citi Bikes in December of 2019. That significantly changed in December of 2020 when older generations, particularly Baby Boomer, increased trip duration.

## Percentage of Citi Bike Users by Gender

Men ride more Citi Bikes than women and unknown gender in Jersey City, NJ. Recent studies have shown that women typically attribute reduced cycling numbers to safety concerns among car traffic. The Jersey City Bike Stations are centrally located in a busy and urban area, located
centrally to access major Jersey City Transit Hubs and access to Lincoln Tunnel.

## The Proportion of Short-Term Customers & Annual Subscribers

Citi Bike Offers an Annual Membership for only $169 for the entire year. You can take as many rides as you want with the first 45-minute of each ride included. Otherwise, customers may choose to pay $3 for Single Trips or $15 per day for 30-minute trips. In December 2020, the proportion of Short-Term Customers surpassed the proportion of Annual Subscribers in Ridership. There has been a sharp decline in mass transit ridership due to the ongoing public health pandemic, and this phenomenon should be explored in greater detail.

## Top Stations for Starting & Ending a Journey

The top stations for both ending and starting a Jersey City journey are Grove Street PATH Train Station, Sip Avenue, Newport PKWY stations sit right outside major Jersey City transportation hubs, where riders can take PATH trains into other areas of Jersey City, Hoboken, downtown/midtown Manhattan. It is also interesting to note that in December of 2020, JC Medical emerged in the Top 10 stations due to its proximity to the Jersey City Medical Center. This could be attributed to the ongoing pandemic. Many healthcare professionals are using Citi Bike to travel to and from work.

# Analysis

It appears that the Jersey Citi Bike program is a popular method of transportation to connect
residents to major transportation hubs around Jersey City. The program should increase its usage
among women riders and assess what factors influence the switch from subscription plans to
short-term customer usage.
